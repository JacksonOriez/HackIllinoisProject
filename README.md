# Real Time Flight

The idea for this project came from looking at the different functions that the Amadeus API had to offer. Our idea was to create functions of our own that would allow us to create a visual representation of flight booking. The project invloves three main parts:
  - The Front-End - a website
  - The Back-End - multiple java classes 
  - The Middle-Man - a server communicating with the amadeus API and our creations
  Sadly, due to time contraints and a somewhat lack of knowledge (we are freshman) we were not able to create the server for said communication. However, as we learn more, we will most likely com back to finish it off.
